 Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Im Krystle. I'm currently working on building an app to relaunch my e-commerce store, you can check out the process here: [Healing Intentions Natrual](https://github.com/krystleM26/hi-app). I'm have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, Express, and Sql.  A fun fact about me is that I love the great outdoors on the weekends, and if you want to get in contact with me you can [e-mail](mitchell.krystle@gmail.com) or send me a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystle-mitchell/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/teawithkrystle).
